Very simple pacman clone writtin in C using the Raylib (one of the best libraries I've ever used).

A great first attempt to create a game but the complexity got away from me, at this point it's easier to start over. C is a great language but I just don't know it as well as C# and it's missing many of the things that make developing in C# great. No collections (except arrays), no easy way to add methods, and all the code being on one page for simplicity (linking the code can be a nightmare). I think it's better if I just take what I learned here and code my game in a more modern framework/engine.
